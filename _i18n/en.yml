            Lausanne 2020 is the ambition of creating a new sports platform for youth by actively involving them in the event’s preparation and organization.

All this while making the Youth Olympic Games a creative laboratory; incubator of ideas of youth, for youth, while drawing inspiration from Switzerland’s heritage and unique assets in education, culture and innovation.
