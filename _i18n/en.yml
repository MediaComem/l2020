      title1: Lausanne 2020’s legacy
      txt1: |
            The Youth Olympic Games is a genuine catalyst of projects and provides a wonderful opportunity to invest sustainably and intelligently in sports, education, culture and infrastructures. It will leave a positive legacy to the city of Lausanne, the canton of Vaud and Swiss sports.
      txt2: |
            One of the key highlights of Lausanne 2020’s heritage is the accelerated construction of the student accommodation VORTEX, which will house the Olympic Village during the Games. This building will accommodate 1,200 university students and academic guests, answering a longtime community need.

               You can follow the development of the Vortex live by consulting the webcam of the construction site. To do so,

      title2: Athletic legacy
      txt3: |
            Another construction project that will see the day for the Youth Olympic Games is Espace Malley, which encompasses several athletic installations, one of which is an ice rink (capacity of 9,700 seats), that will be available to young athletes. This project solves the problem of a genuine lack of sports infrastructures in the French-speaking part of Switzerland.

      txt4: |
            Besides these two major constructions, Lausanne 2020 will promote the following projects:  
      list1: ' -  the creation of training centers for the future athletes of the French-speaking part of Switzerland;'
      list2: ' -	an agreement with the department of French Jura for free use of athletic infrastructures during 20 years;'
      list3: ' -	usupport for creating a new regional sport – Short Track;'
      list4: ' -	local training dedicated to sports management of major events;'
      list5: ' -	development of a new generation of sports managers.'
      list6: ' And last but not least, tangible projects underway to promote winter sports for everyone.'
      title3: Educational legacy
      txt6: |
            Lausanne 2020’s educational legacy will be a combination of several elements. First, there are the strong partnerships with University of Lausanne (UNIL), Federal Polytechnical School of Lausanne (EPFL) and Swiss Hotel Management School in Lausanne (EHL). Second is the identification and the development of local youth’s existing skills. And third is the creation of new expertise within this same population. To make this happen, an opportunity has been given to youth to invest themselves and take on organizational responsibilities in the Youth Olympic Games. These learned skills will be available for organizing future international sports events that will continue to burgeon sustainably in the region.
      txt7: "And it doesn’t stop here! This transmission will touch younger generations, thanks to connections established with children in local schools."
